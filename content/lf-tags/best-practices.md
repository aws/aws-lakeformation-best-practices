# LF-Tag best practices

## Integrating with LF-Tags

When integrating with LF-Tags, there are few suggestions on how to successfully adopt LF-Tags. See the following list of advice:

* Define your LF-Tag ontology for your current and future needs. Adding or changing the ontology will require additional work in the future.

* Make note of the limitations that currently exists. For example, LF-Tags currently does not support tagging resources with multiple values from the same LF-Tag. See the [limitations](limitations.md) for details.

* Keep the tagging ontology as simple as possible. Having too many LF-Tags can make it difficult to manage and track permissions.

* Document the tagging ontology and share with data stewards so that they are very clear when/how to use the LF-Tags. 

* LF-Tag permissioning and Named Resource policies can exist together. The effective permissions for a user is the union of permissions of all named resource policies and LF-Tag policies.
